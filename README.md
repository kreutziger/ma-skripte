# getMetalArchiveInfo

Because of queries to clarify the purpose of this tool, the intended use is, to simplify the creation of running order spreadsheets. That is why the output is seperated csv-file friendly and you can read in and write out any of the input or output data.

## TODOS

* add functionality (e.g. get lyrics for songs etc.)

## Known Problems

If a country is not in the country dict, the output can break, just add the country to the dictionary. Also you should use the -l/--logo option only on bands and album searches.
